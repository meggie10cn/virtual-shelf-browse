GETTING UP AND RUNNING

    You will first want to get the virtualshelfindex web service working. Then you
    can work on the shelf-browse application that uses the web service.
    
    Instructions to help you get the web service up and running are found in README.txt
    in the virtualshelfindex/ directory.
    
    Likewise, instructions for getting the front end applications up and running
    can be found in the browse-shelf/ directory.
